# Joint-Decoding-Freamwork-for-LDPC-coded-MIMO-SCMA-Systems-Based-on-Expectation-Propagation
simulation code for the joint decoding problem for the non-binary LDPC code SCMA system with multiple transceive antennas. The Expectation propagation is adopted, computational complexity grows linearly with the size of SCMA constellation and the number of non-orthogonal users.
